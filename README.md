# Thiago's Guide To Everything

Hello! I'm Thiago and this is a place where I share some of my discoveries with the world. The main purpose of this page is to serve as a storage to index my own findings and useful things I learn and usually forget after a while - like a "memory vault" if you will. Feel free to snoop around.
